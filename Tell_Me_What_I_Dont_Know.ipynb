description with precise attributes that categorize the nature of the engagement - such as ‘who’ carried out ‘what’ with ‘whom’. The description can be very wordy, such as an attached email trail. We seek to summarize these, capturing highlights beyond our known attributes. Using T5 summarization (Raffel et al 2020) of the non-anonymized CNN-DailyMail dataset (See et al 2017) as a baseline, we seek a methodology that significantly de-emphasises what we already know to summarize the next most salient information. T5 summarization is a Transformer architecture that uses self-attention mechanisms to solve multiple text processing problems. \n","\n","We will assign one @highlight of each article as our prior knowledge. We will use ROUGE success metrics (Ganesan 2018) to determine whether our summaries resemble our labels, and cross examine labels with prior knowledge to identify and possibly exclude existing dependencies. We could try excluding prior knowledge from model training if it had consistent characteristics, however we expect to show this is not true of our analogous public dataset.\n","\n","A simple solution might be to generate two summary sentences and eliminate the sentence that more closely resembles prior knowledge. The result may still contain significant prior knowledge. We will also explore the potential of using Maximal Marginal Relevance (Rachman et al 2019; Carbinell et al 2016) and Integer Linear Programming (Roth & Srikumar 2016) to select summary sentences that avoid redundant facts.\n","\n","An efficient methodology may involve adjusting the model for each article to de-emphasise prior knowledge. This may resemble debiasing, however it will change for every article. Rebuilding the model each time is unlikely to be practical.

Self-attention is a variant of attention (Graves, 2013; Bahdanau et al., 2015) that processes a sequence by replacing each element by a weighted average of the rest of the sequence.\n","\n","Overall, our encoder-decoder Transformer implementation closely follows its originally proposed form (Vaswani et al., 2017). First, an input sequence of tokens is mapped to a sequence of embeddings, which is then passed into the encoder. The encoder consists of a stack of “blocks”, each of which comprises two subcomponents: a self-attention layer followed by a small feed-forward network. Layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016) is applied to the input of each subcomponent. We use a simplified version of layer normalization where\n","the activations are only rescaled and no additive bias is applied. After layer normalization, a residual skip connection (He et al., 2016) adds each subcomponent’s input to its output.\n","Dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) is applied within the feed-forward network, on the skip connection, on the attention weights, and at the input and output of the entire stack. The decoder is similar in structure to the encoder except that it includes a standard attention mechanism after each self-attention layer that attends to the output of the encoder. The self-attention mechanism in the decoder also uses a form of autoregressive or causal selfattention,\n","which only allows the model to attend to past outputs. The output of the final\n","decoder block is fed into a dense layer with a softmax output, whose weights are shared with the input embedding matrix. All attention mechanisms in the Transformer are split up into independent “heads” whose outputs are concatenated before being further processed.\n","\n","In this work, we use 32 embeddings for all of our models with ranges that increase in size logarithmically up to an offset of 128 beyond which we assign all relative positions to the same embedding. Note that a given layer is insensitive to relative position beyond 128 tokens, but subsequent layers\n","can build a sensitivity to larger offsets by combining local information from previous layers.\n","\n","we use a combination of model and data parallelism and train models on “slices” of Cloud TPU Pods.5 TPU pods are are multi-rack ML supercomputers that contain 1,024 TPU v3 chips connected via a high-speed 2D mesh interconnect with\n","supporting CPU host machines. We leverage the Mesh TensorFlow library (Shazeer et al., 2018) for ease of implementation of both model parallelism and data parallelism (Krizhevsky, 2014).\n","\n","The CNN/Daily Mail (Hermann et al., 2015) data set was introduced as a question answering task but was adapted for text summarization by Nallapati et al. (2016); we use the non-anonymized version from See et al. (2017) as an abstractive summarization task. SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) is a common question- answering benchmark. In our experiments, the model is fed the question and its context and asked to generate the answer token-by-token.\n","\n","Note that the choice of text prefix used for a given task is essentially a hyperparameter; we found that changing the exact wording of the prefix had limited impact and so did not perform extensive experiments into different prefix choices.\n","\n","Our baseline model is designed so that the encoder and decoder are each similar in size and configuration to a “BERTBASE” (Devlin et al., 2018) stack. Specifically, both the encoder and decoder consist of 12 blocks (each block comprising self-attention, optional encoder-decoder attention, and a feed-forward network). The feed-forward networks in each block consist of a dense layer with an output dimensionality of dff = 3072 followed by a ReLU nonlinearity and another dense layer. The “key” and “value” matrices of all attention mechanisms have an inner dimensionality of dkv = 64 and all attention mechanisms have 12 heads. All other sub-layers and embeddings have a dimensionality of dmodel = 768. In total, this results in a model with about 220 million parameters. This is roughly twice the number of parameters of BERTBASE since our baseline model contains two layer stacks instead of one. For regularization, we use a dropout probability of 0.1 everywhere dropout is applied in the model.\n","\n","we use a vocabulary of 32,000 wordpieces.\n","\n","As a cheaper alternative, we train our baseline model 10 times from scratch (i.e. with different random initializations and data set shuffling) and assume that the variance over these runs of the base model also applies to each experimental variant. We don’t expect most of the changes we make to have a dramatic effect on the inter-run variance, so this should provide a reasonable indication of the significance of different changes.\n","\n","For CNN/Daily Mail, we find the performance of models on the ROUGE-1-F, ROUGE-2-F, and ROUGE-L-F metrics (Lin, 2004) to be highly correlated so we report the ROUGE-2-F score alone under the heading “CNNDM”.\n","\n","[regarding baselines, pre-training is marginal for very large datasets but our CNN dataset is not very large]\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"J_bp4bs2U3Hx"},"source":["# I.

''\n","\n","It 's a step that is set to turn an international crisis into a fierce domestic political battle .\n","\n","There are key questions looming over the debate : What did U.N. weapons inspectors find in Syria ? What happens if Congress votes no ? And how will the Syrian government react ?\n","\n","In a televised address from the White House Rose Garden earlier Saturday , the president said he would take his case to Congress , not because he has to -- but because he wants to .\n","\n","`` While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization , I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course , and our actions will be even more effective , '' he said . `` We should have this debate , because the issues are too big for business as usual .

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Ban , who has said he wants to wait until the U.N. team 's final report is completed before presenting it to the U.N. Security Council .\n","\n","The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons , which nine of the inspectors belong to , said Saturday that it could take up to three weeks to analyze the evidence they collected .\n","\n","`` It needs time to be able to analyze the information and the samples , '' Nesirky said .\n","\n","He noted that Ban has repeatedly said there is no alternative to a political solution to the crisis in Syria , and that `` a military solution is not an option .

Some U.S. lawmakers have called for immediate action while others warn of stepping into what could become a quagmire .\n","\n","Some global leaders have expressed support , but the British Parliament 's vote against military action earlier this week was a blow to Obama 's hopes of getting strong backing from key NATO allies .\n","\n","On Saturday , Obama proposed what he said would be a limited military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad . Any military attack would not be open-ended or include U.S. ground forces , he said .\n","\n","Syria 's alleged use of chemical weapons earlier this month `` is an assault on human dignity , '' the president said .\n","\n","A failure to respond with force , Obama argued , `` could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm .

A senior administration official told CNN that Obama has the authority to act without Congress -- even if Congress rejects his request for authorization to use force .\n","\n","Obama on Saturday continued to shore up support for a strike on the al-Assad government .\n","\n","He spoke by phone with French President Francois Hollande before his Rose Garden speech .\n","\n","`` The two leaders agreed that the international community must deliver a resolute message to the Assad regime -- and others who would consider using chemical weapons -- that these crimes are unacceptable and those who violate this international norm will be held accountable by the world , '' the White House said .\n","\n","Meanwhile , as uncertainty loomed over how Congress would weigh in , U.S. military officials said they remained at the ready .\n","\n","5 key assertions : U.S. intelligence report on Syria\n","\n","Syria : Who wants what after chemical weapons horror\n","\n","Reactions mixed to Obama 's speech\n","\n","A spokesman for the Syrian National Coalition said that the opposition group was disappointed by Obama 's announcement .\n","\n","`` Our fear now is that the lack of action could embolden the regime and they repeat his attacks in a more serious way , '' said spokesman Louay Safi . `` So we are quite concerned . ''\n","\n","Some members of Congress applauded Obama 's decision .\n","\n","House Speaker John Boehner , Majority Leader Eric Cantor , Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy and Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers issued a statement Saturday praising the president .\n","\n","`` Under the Constitution , the responsibility to declare war lies with Congress , '' the Republican lawmakers said . `` We are glad the president is seeking authorization for any military action in Syria in response to serious , substantive questions being raised . ''\n","\n","More than 160 legislators , including 63 of Obama 's fellow Democrats , had signed letters calling for either a vote or at least a `` full debate '' before any U.S. action .\n","\n","British Prime Minister David Cameron , whose own attempt to get lawmakers in his country to support military action in Syria failed earlier this week , responded to Obama 's speech in a Twitter post Saturday .\n","\n","`` I understand and support Barack Obama 's position on Syria , '' Cameron said .\n","\n","An influential lawmaker in Russia -- which has stood by Syria and criticized the United States -- had his own theory .\n","\n","`` The main reason Obama is turning to the Congress : the military operation did not get enough support either in the world , among allies of the US or in the United States itself , '' Alexei Pushkov , chairman of the international-affairs committee of the Russian State Duma , said in a Twitter post .\n","\n","In the United States , scattered groups of anti-war protesters around the country took to the streets Saturday .\n","\n","`` Like many other Americans ... we 're just tired of the United States getting involved and invading and bombing other countries , '' said Robin Rosecrans , who was among hundreds at a Los Angeles demonstration .\n","\n","What do Syria 's neighbors think ?\n","\n","Why Russia , China , Iran stand by Assad\n","\n","Syria 's government unfazed\n","\n","After Obama 's speech , a military and political analyst on Syrian state TV said Obama is `` embarrassed '' that Russia opposes military action against Syria , is `` crying for help '' for someone to come to his rescue and is facing two defeats -- on the political and military levels .\n","\n","Syria 's prime minister appeared unfazed by the saber-rattling .\n","\n","`` The Syrian Army 's status is on maximum readiness and fingers are on the trigger to confront all challenges , '' Wael Nader al-Halqi said during a meeting with a delegation of Syrian expatriates from Italy , according to a banner on Syria State TV that was broadcast prior to Obama 's address .\n","\n","An anchor on Syrian state television said Obama `` appeared to be preparing for an aggression on Syria based on repeated lies .

What happens if Congress votes no ? And how will the Syrian government react ?\n","\n","In a televised address from the White House Rose Garden earlier Saturday , the president said he would take his case to Congress , not because he has to -- but because he wants to .\n","\n","`` While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization , I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course , and our actions will be even more effective , '' he said . `` We should have this debate , because the issues are too big for business as usual .

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Ban , who has said he wants to wait until the U.N. team 's final report is completed before presenting it to the U.N.

''\n","\n","It 's a step that is set to turn an international crisis into a fierce domestic political battle .\n","\n","There are key questions looming over the debate : What did U.N. weapons inspectors find in Syria ? What happens if Congress votes no ? And how will the Syrian government react ?\n","\n","In a televised address from the White House Rose Garden earlier Saturday , the president said he would take his case to Congress , not because he has to -- but because he wants to .\n","\n","`` While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization , I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course , and our actions will be even more effective , '' he said . `` We should have this debate , because the issues are too big for business as usual . ''\n","\n","Obama said top congressional leaders had agreed to schedule a debate when the body returns to Washington on September 9 .

Robert Menendez said .\n","\n","Transcript : Read Obama 's full remarks\n","\n","Syrian crisis : Latest developments\n","\n","U.N. inspectors leave Syria\n","\n","Obama 's remarks came shortly after U.N. inspectors left Syria , carrying evidence that will determine whether chemical weapons were used in an attack early last week in a Damascus suburb .\n","\n","`` The aim of the game here , the mandate , is very clear -- and that is to ascertain whether chemical weapons were used -- and not by whom , '' U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters on Saturday .\n","\n","But who used the weapons in the reported toxic gas attack in a Damascus suburb on August 21 has been a key point of global debate over the Syrian crisis .\n","\n","Top U.S. officials have said there 's no doubt that the Syrian government was behind it , while Syrian officials have denied responsibility and blamed jihadists fighting with the rebels .\n","\n","British and U.S. intelligence reports say the attack involved chemical weapons , but U.N. officials have stressed the importance of waiting for an official report from inspectors .\n","\n","The inspectors will share their findings with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Ban , who has said he wants to wait until the U.N. team 's final report is completed before presenting it to the U.N. Security Council .\n","\n","The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons , which nine of the inspectors belong to , said Saturday that it could take up to three weeks to analyze the evidence they collected .\n","\n","`` It needs time to be able to analyze the information and the samples , '' Nesirky said .\n","\n","He noted that Ban has repeatedly said there is no alternative to a political solution to the crisis in Syria , and that `` a military solution is not an option .

Some U.S. lawmakers have called for immediate action while others warn of stepping into what could become a quagmire .\n","\n","Some global leaders have expressed support , but the British Parliament 's vote against military action earlier this week was a blow to Obama 's hopes of getting strong backing from key NATO allies .\n","\n","On Saturday , Obama proposed what he said would be a limited military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad . Any military attack would not be open-ended or include U.S. ground forces , he said .\n","\n","Syria 's alleged use of chemical weapons earlier this month `` is an assault on human dignity , '' the president said .\n","\n","A failure to respond with force , Obama argued , `` could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm .

A senior administration official told CNN that Obama has the authority to act without Congress -- even if Congress rejects his request for authorization to use force .\n","\n","Obama on Saturday continued to shore up support for a strike on the al-Assad government .\n","\n","He spoke by phone with French President Francois Hollande before his Rose Garden speech .\n","\n","`` The two leaders agreed that the international community must deliver a resolute message to the Assad regime -- and others who would consider using chemical weapons -- that these crimes are unacceptable and those who violate this international norm will be held accountable by the world , '' the White House said .\n","\n","Meanwhile , as uncertainty loomed over how Congress would weigh in , U.S. military officials said they remained at the ready .\n","\n","5 key assertions : U.S. intelligence report on Syria\n","\n","Syria : Who wants what after chemical weapons horror\n","\n","Reactions mixed to Obama 's speech\n","\n","A spokesman for the Syrian National Coalition said that the opposition group was disappointed by Obama 's announcement .\n","\n","`` Our fear now is that the lack of action could embolden the regime and they repeat his attacks in a more serious way , '' said spokesman Louay Safi . `` So we are quite concerned . ''\n","\n","Some members of Congress applauded Obama 's decision .\n","\n","House Speaker John Boehner , Majority Leader Eric Cantor , Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy and Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers issued a statement Saturday praising the president .\n","\n","`` Under the Constitution , the responsibility to declare war lies with Congress , '' the Republican lawmakers said . `` We are glad the president is seeking authorization for any military action in Syria in response to serious , substantive questions being raised . ''\n","\n","More than 160 legislators , including 63 of Obama 's fellow Democrats , had signed letters calling for either a vote or at least a `` full debate '' before any U.S. action .\n","\n","British Prime Minister David Cameron , whose own attempt to get lawmakers in his country to support military action in Syria failed earlier this week , responded to Obama 's speech in a Twitter post Saturday .\n","\n","`` I understand and support Barack Obama 's position on Syria , '' Cameron said .\n","\n","An influential lawmaker in Russia -- which has stood by Syria and criticized the United States -- had his own theory .\n","\n","`` The main reason Obama is turning to the Congress : the military operation did not get enough support either in the world , among allies of the US or in the United States itself , '' Alexei Pushkov , chairman of the international-affairs committee of the Russian State Duma , said in a Twitter post .\n","\n","In the United States , scattered groups of anti-war protesters around the country took to the streets Saturday .\n","\n","`` Like many other Americans ... we 're just tired of the United States getting involved and invading and bombing other countries , '' said Robin Rosecrans , who was among hundreds at a Los Angeles demonstration .\n","\n","What do Syria 's neighbors think ?\n","\n","Why Russia , China , Iran stand by Assad\n","\n","Syria 's government unfazed\n","\n","After Obama 's speech , a military and political analyst on Syrian state TV said Obama is `` embarrassed '' that Russia opposes military action against Syria , is `` crying for help '' for someone to come to his rescue and is facing two defeats -- on the political and military levels .\n","\n","Syria 's prime minister appeared unfazed by the saber-rattling .\n","\n","`` The Syrian Army 's status is on maximum readiness and fingers are on the trigger to confront all challenges , '' Wael Nader al-Halqi said during a meeting with a delegation of Syrian expatriates from Italy , according to a banner on Syria State TV that was broadcast prior to Obama 's address .\n","\n","An anchor on Syrian state television said Obama `` appeared to be preparing for an aggression on Syria based on repeated lies .
