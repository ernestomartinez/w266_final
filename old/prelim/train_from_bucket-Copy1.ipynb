      "The proposed legislation from Obama asks Congress to approve the use of military force `` to deter , disrupt , prevent and degrade the potential for future uses of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction . ''\n",

      "In a televised address from the White House Rose Garden earlier Saturday , the president said he would take his case to Congress , not because he has to -- but because he wants to .\n",
      "\n",
      "`` While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization , I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course , and our actions will be even more effective , '' he said . `` We should have this debate , because the issues are too big for business as usual . ''\n",

      "But who used the weapons in the reported toxic gas attack in a Damascus suburb on August 21 has been a key point of global debate over the Syrian crisis .\n",
      "\n",
      "Top U.S. officials have said there 's no doubt that the Syrian government was behind it , while Syrian officials have denied responsibility and blamed jihadists fighting with the rebels .\n",

      "British and U.S. intelligence reports say the attack involved chemical weapons , but U.N. officials have stressed the importance of waiting for an official report from inspectors .\n",
